# SudoLang.ai Mentorship Landing Flow PRD

## Problem Description
Eric Elliott's audience trusts his systematic development methodology but doesn't understand how it applies to AI development. They're frustrated with "vibe coding" (fragile AI-generated code) and need a bridge from proven software practices to systematic AI development.

## Solution Description
A landing page that positions AI Driven Development (AIDD) as the natural evolution of proven methodologies Eric's audience already knows and trusts - TDD, code review, continuous delivery - applied to AI driven development through SudoLang.

## Core Hook & Messaging
**Primary Hook**: "Learn AI Driven Development (AIDD) with the creator of SudoLang: the language designed specifically for AI Driven Development."

**Bridge Message**: "Code is not the point. Just like human-powered development,AIDD is about breaking down problems into bite-size pieces using the same quality methods we use with humans: Product Planning, TDD, Code Review, Continuous Delivery, and automations that eliminate common mistakes."

## User Journey Guide

### Primary Persona: Eric Elliott Follower

**User action**: Reviews ecosystem components (book, tools, methodology)
**Key conversion**: Trusts Eric can teach systematic AI development

### Stage 4: Value Realization (5-15 minutes)
**User sees**: Complete AIDD ecosystem vs piecemeal AI tutorials
**User thinks**: "This is comprehensive system for reliable AI development"
**User action**: Calculates investment vs productivity gains from systematic approach
**Key conversion**: Sees ROI of systematic methodology vs continued vibe coding

### Stage 5: Application Confidence (15-25 minutes)
**User sees**: Mentorship application form
**User thinks**: "I trust Eric's teaching ability and systematic approach"
**User action**: Fills application describing current AI development frustrations
**Key conversion**: Applies for mentorship with confidence in methodology

### Stage 6: Conversion (Payment)
**User receives**: Payment link + immediate ecosystem access
