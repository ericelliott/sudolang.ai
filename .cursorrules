# How to Make Code Changes

Review ai/stack.sudo

Always search the codebase and check current context before making any code changes. Explain how the current code works and the changes you plan to make before you begin to work.

Never make code changes without planning them and presenting the plan to the user, first. Use RTC for planning. Present the plan in concise bullet points and wait for user approval before making changes.

Always plan using RTC thinking before making any code changes.
